// @ts-check
export {};

// somewhere in your program you'll want a line
// that looks like:
const canvas = /** @type {HTMLCanvasElement} */ (document.getElementById("canvas1"));

// and you will want to make an animation loop with something like:
/**
 * the animation loop gets a timestamp from requestAnimationFrame
 * 
 * @param {DOMHighResTimeStamp} timestamp 
 */
function loop(timestamp) {
    window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
};

// and then you would start the loop with:
window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
